A basic .ino file to leverage WS2812B LED strip control with google assistant, IFTTT, and Blynk

###TL;DR;
I had this idea to have a voice controlled LED strip on my kitchen/bed, and after a LOT of research, I came up with this code and setup.

## Hardware Parts
1 - NodeMCU ESP8266
2 - WS2812B LED strip.
3 - 200 Ohm resistor (Optional).
4 - Jumper Wires.
5 - Solderless breadboard (For prototyping. Optional).

## Schemas
Basically, there are 2 possible schemas for this, one, using the USB as power source for all the circuit, and other using an external power source.

### USB as power source
